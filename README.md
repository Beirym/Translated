# How it works

The translator accepts the text for translation, the language from which the translation will be performed and the language into which the translation will be performed. Additionally, you can specify exception words that will not be translated. Also, due to the mechanics of "googletrans", a space is automatically placed after each character - "/", it can be deleted by setting a certain parameter.
